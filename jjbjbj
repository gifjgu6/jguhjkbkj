Write a code to develop a 2D grid of integers. Each of the boxes in the grid contains an integer. You have to identify the cell whose sum of adjacent cells is maximum. Alternatively you can print another 2D grid that contains the sum of adjacent cells for each existent cell.  You should take input from the user, an integer n. Then construct a nxn 2D array/matrix. Take input from the user about the different elements of the matrix. Then print two integers, i and j, which will be the index of the cell whose sum of adjacent cells is maximum.
